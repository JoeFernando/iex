\usage{
last(symbols = NULL, fields = NULL, version = "1.0")
}
\arguments{
\item{symbols}{a vector of tickers (case insensitive). Special characters
will be escaped. A list of eligible symbols is
\href{https://iextrading.com/trading/eligible-symbols/}{published daily} by the
IEX. When set to \code{NULL} (default) returns values for all symbols.}

\item{fields}{a vector of fields names to return (case sensitive). When
set to \code{NULL} (default) returns values for all fields.}

\item{version}{the API version number (default: \code{"1.0"}) which is used to
define the API URL.}
}
\value{
an S3 object of class \code{iex_api} which has three accessible fields:
\code{path}, \code{response} and \code{content} containing the API path, the unparsed API
response and the parsed content from the API's response (the latter usually
being a list). Note that this package causes R to pause 0.2 seconds after
executing an API call to avoid the user being throttled by the API (which
enforces a 5 request per second limit)
